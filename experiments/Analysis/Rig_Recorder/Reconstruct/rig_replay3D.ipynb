    "This application allows users to load data from a directory containing images and movement/graph data. The UI is built with PyQt and integrates both 2D graphs and 3D visualizations of movement data. Users can navigate through timepoints using a slider, view image frames alongside the graphs, and switch between 2D and 3D views."

    "\n",
    "To run the `IntegratedTimeline` application, you need to ensure that the required packages are installed. Below is a guide for setting up a `conda` environment with Python 3.11.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Conda Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Anaconda or Miniconda** (if not already installed).\n",
    "   - You can download Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).\n",
    "   - Alternatively, Miniconda is a lightweight version that you can download [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Conda Environment**:\n",
    "   Open a terminal or command prompt and create a new environment using the following command:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   conda create -n IntegratedTimeline python=3.11\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Activate the Environment**:\n",
    "   After the environment is created, activate it:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   conda activate IntegratedTimeline\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Installing Required Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the environment is activated, you need to install the required Python packages. Here’s the list of required packages for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pyqtgraph`\n",
    "- `PyQt5`\n",
    "- `PyOpenGL`\n",
    "- `numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "To install these, use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install PyQt5 and pyqtgraph for the UI and plotting\n",
    "conda install pyqt=5 pyqtgraph\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install PyOpenGL for 3D visualization\n",
    "pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install NumPy for array manipulation\n",
    "conda install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Install Any Additional Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter any issues, ensure that the following packages are installed as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install pillow  # For handling image files\n",
    "conda install matplotlib  # For additional plotting options\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: YAML File for Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "For ease of setup, you can also create the environment from a `YAML` file. Here’s an example `environment.yaml`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "name: IntegratedTimeline\n",
    "channels:\n",
    "  - defaults\n",
    "dependencies:\n",
    "  - python=3.11\n",
    "  - pyqt=5\n",
    "  - pyqtgraph\n",
    "  - numpy\n",
    "  - pip\n",
    "  - pip:\n",
    "    - PyOpenGL\n",
    "    - PyOpenGL_accelerate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an environment from this file, save it as `environment.yaml` and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yaml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Running the Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the environment is set up and the required packages are installed, you can run the application by executing the Python script:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python rig_replay3D.py\n",
    "```"
